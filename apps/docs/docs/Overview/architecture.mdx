# Architecture Overview

Learnify follows a monorepo architecture using Nx.js to organize its codebase efficiently. The system comprises several components, each serving a specific purpose.

## Monorepo with Nx.js

Learnify's codebase is organized using Nx.js, which allows for efficient management of multiple projects within a single repository.

## Components

Learnify consists of the following main components:

- **Admin Panel**: Built with Next.js, it allows administrators to manage content, view user statistics, and perform various administrative tasks.

- **Mobile Application**: Developed using React Native, the mobile app provides users with access to course-related content, quizzes, blogs, forums, and an AI-powered question-answering feature.

- **Backend**: Powered by Nest.js and PostgreSQL, the backend serves as the core of Learnify, handling user authentication, content storage, and AI-related services.
